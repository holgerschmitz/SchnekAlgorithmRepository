# Huerto: A repository of algorithms for Schnek

A repository of numerical algorithms and ready to use simulation blocks. Pick and mix modules to create your individual simulation code.

Wherever possible, algorithms are written so that they can be compiled in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. By setting on of the macros `HUERTO_ONE_DIM`, `HUERTO_TWO_DIM`, or `HUERTO_THREE_DIM` the dimensionality of the algorithms. Handy type definitions depending on the dimensionality are defined in `types.hpp`.
